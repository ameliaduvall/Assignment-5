# Assignment-5

This repository contains data and code necessary to complete assignment #5 for FSH 497 - Intro to Environmental Data Science.

In class this week we learned about some graphic design principles, which included an example of creating an expository figure from an initial exploratory figure. The assignment  is to use the provided dataset (siscowet.csv) to:
1. begin by creating an exploratory figure youâ€™d like about any aspect of the data, and
2. create an expository figure that builds upon your original figure.
